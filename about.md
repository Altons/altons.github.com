 3rd reincarnation as Statistician (I will be a millionaire footballer on the next one). Born in an exotic country called Venezuela but embraced the British ways long time ago. Always learning new stuff even though I may not use it.  Social hacker, Atari veteran, Judo aficionado & dogs lover.  


 Great believer of statistics as vehicle for society improvement
