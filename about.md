  2nd reincarnation as Statistician (I will be a millionaire footballer on the next one). Born in an exotic country called Venezuela but embraced the British ways long time ago. Always learning new stuff even though I may not use it.  Atari veteran, Judo aficionado, chef on the making & dogs lover.  


 Never forget this: ***Truth***  is always *absolute* and *relative*  - that's a fact due to the duality we experience in this dimension.
